				<p class="ptext">PORTRAIT SHOOTING</p>
				<p class="podtext1">Portrait photography or portrait photography in photographs is a photograph of a person or group of people that captures the individuality of an object using effective lighting, backgrounds and poses. Portrait painting can be artistic or clinical.</p>
				<p class="podtext2">Look for aesthetic photos that are pleasant to keep as a keepsake, as well as use in work and for everyday purposes. You can apply for portrait photography for yourself or order a gift certificate for your near and dear ones.<br>
				Of course, there are some rules for taking a portrait, and an experienced photographer knows them. These nuances relate to the location of the model relative to the background, head rotation, smile and some other points. But much depends on the model itself, on its mood and artistry. The more interesting the model, the more successful the shot can be. And the more people will pay attention to him.</p>

			<p class="ptext1">ADVERTISING</p>
			<p class="podtext11">Advertising photography is a special kind of photography. Advertising photography is one of the types of "commercial photography" and includes almost all genres, but does not replace any of them. This term characterizes images: Fashion and fashionable objects of advertising layouts, advertisements in the press; outdoor advertising; calendars</p>
			<p class="podtext21">As a rule, the client’s technical task for photographing formulates the problem only in general terms, without unnecessary specifics: “demonstrate the style, beauty, sophistication of the product, ease of use”. Such general tasks, on the one hand, give the photographer much more creative freedom, but at the same time complicate his work. After all, an advertising photographer has to not only think through all the scenes, select the light and angle, but sometimes choose their own atmosphere, locations, interiors, clothes, specific models to achieve the desired effect.Giving such freedom to your photographer, you must be 100% sure of his professionalism and skill, because every shooting day spent is a serious part of your advertising budget, and sometimes a waste of invaluable time. Especially if the advertising photo is preparing for a seasonal promotion, and the advertising space has already been paid.</p>

	    	<p class="ptext8">Wedding photos</p>
	    	<p class="podtext13">Wedding photography - a direction in photography, designed to artistically capture the events taking place during the wedding. This genre in photography requires the photographer to be able to combine such genres as portrait, photojournalism, documentary photography, and art photography in his work.</p>
	    	<p class="podtext23">The role of the wedding photographer as a person who documents one of the most important days of a new family’s life can hardly be overestimated. It goes without saying that this work should be done with an excellent assessment. Many important moments of the solemn day are fleeting, they are easy to miss and they will be lost forever. It is normal that the photographer will be nervous, given the situation and all the responsibility that falls on his shoulders. That is why you need to be sure that you are fully prepared for the big day, then it is easy to focus on precious moments that will not sink into oblivion, but will remain for many years in the memory card.<br>
	    	The approach to wedding photography, the necessary equipment, methods - all this may differ from what you use when shooting other types of photography. Pay attention to the following checklist. It can be invaluable.</p>

	    	<p class="ptext2">PHOTOSET FOR CARS</p>
	        <p class="podtext12">A great option to add variety to the leisure of filming lovers is a photo shoot with a car. Such photosets allow participants to realize many images, convey different moods and characters. Thoroughly thought out the style, picking up accessories and props, you will make the shooting memorable. And at such an event, you will have a great time and take your mind off everyday activities.</p>
	        <p class="podtext22">Decide on the subject and direction of shooting. Choose one or more sets of clothes for changing the image and the corresponding accessories.<br>
	        Pay attention to the appearance of the machine - it must be impeccable. Visit a car wash or tidy up your car yourself. If you plan to take pictures not only near the transport, but also inside it, take care of the cleanliness of the cabin.<br>
	        A photo shoot with a car should not be spoiled by restrictions and limits. If you dream of retro-themed scene photos or professional themed shooting in a convertible, but you don’t have a suitable car, then it’s not a problem. You can always rent it.</p>

	      	<p class="ptext9">Interior photography</p>
	      	<p class="podtext14">It is used by organizations operating in the field of interior design, furniture and accessories production, enterprises and services provided to provide information about the physical environment and realtors to inform buyers and tenants about the proposed premises.</p>
	      	<p class="podtext24">For interior photography, a plot photo series is created that can convey the features of planning and design, the functional and aesthetic organization of the interior space of offices, buildings and structures.<br>
	      	The main technical problem in interior photography is the extremely wide range of brightness of objects, from brightly lit window openings and light sources in the frame, to deep shadows.<br>
	      	In this regard, interior photography has two main methodologies - with illumination with additional light sources (usually combined with replacing regular light sources with weaker ones), or with the use of HDRI technologies.</p>
